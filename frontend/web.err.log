The following packages should be updated for best compatibility with the installed expo version:
  react-native-svg@15.15.2 - expected version: 15.12.1
  react-native-worklets@0.5.2 - expected version: 0.5.1
Your project may not work correctly until you install the expected versions of the packages.
